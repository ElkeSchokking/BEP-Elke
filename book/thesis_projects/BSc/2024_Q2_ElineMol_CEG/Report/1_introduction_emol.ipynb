    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last century, the Earth’s climate has warmed more than 1 °C. In some regions more drought will occur, while other regions will be wetter (IPCC, 2021). In times limited of rainfall, groundwater storages will act as a natural buffer. These storages will provide against water scarcity, limiting evaporation in areas with shallow water tables and sustaining river and wetland baseflows which supports ecosystems and biodiversity (de Graaf et al., 2017). The process of water infiltrating into soil layers and replenishing groundwater is called groundwater recharge. Generally, groundwater is recharged through processes that are controlled by: geology, temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, humidity and land use (Castillo et al., 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "Arid regions such as the Sonoran Desert rely on groundwater as a primary water source according to the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR, 2023). However, long-term groundwater over-pumping poses a significant threat to this resource (PPIC, n.d.). In the Sonoran Desert region, groundwater management has been a pressing priority for decades. For instance, Arizona started regulating groundwater in its largest cities under a new law in 1980, the Groundwater Management Code. This law stated a goal of achieving a long-term balance between the amount of groundwater pumping and the amount of replenishing these buffers (James, 2021). In 2014, California adopted a similar law (Sustainable Groundwater Management Act) to manage and regulate its groundwater sources, as attempt to prevent and recover groundwater depleted basins (Mason, 2014). In Mexico, the Law of the Nation’s Water (LAN) is adopted in 1992, stating the management and regulation of water entitlement. It states the appropriation, allocation and concession of groundwater rights (Cruz-Ayala & Megdal, 2020).\n",

    "Due to growing concerns of the groundwater availability in the future, this report researches what the impact of climate change will be on the groundwater recharge in the Sonoran Desert. The analysis involves determining the threshold for groundwater recharge in the region and projecting future groundwater recharge by simulating three climate scenarios from CMIP6 in the PCR-GlobWB model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This report consists of five chapters. The first chapter serves as the introduction, outlining the research motivation, the problem analysis and the objectives of this study. Chapter 2 details the methodology of this study, focusing on the eWaterCycle platform and its application of the hydrological model PCR-GlobWB. Chapter 3 contains the results generated by this model. Chapter 4 includes a discussion, evaluating the results and reflecting on possible implications. Finally, chapter 5 concludes the report, gives recommendations for the future and provides the answer to the research question."

    "### 1.1 Problem Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sonoran Desert is an arid region with a subtropical climate in the Southwestern of the United States and Northwestern of Mexico. According to the National Park Service (NPS, 2024) the desert covers approximately 260 000 km2 of this region, as shown in Figure 1. In this region, the hydrological system includes many streams and two primary rivers, the Colorado River and the Gila River, Figure 2. A majority of the smaller streams remain dry for most of the year (Kampf et al., 2018). \n",
    "\n",
    "Groundwater serves as the primary water source in the Sonoran Desert region, supporting both the urban, environmental and agricultural sector. The agricultural  sector uses the biggest amount of the available water, about 75% of the available groundwater and surface water (ADWR, 2023; PPIC, n.d.). However, according to the Public Policy Institute of California (n.d.) consistently over pumping is now threatening this resource. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "The Sonoran Desert receives an average annual precipitation of 76-500 mm. Majority of the rainfall occurs during the summer monsoon thunderstorms. However, it also receives frequent low-intensity winter rains. Precipitation generally increases with elevation, due to orographic effects. A significant amount is occurring as snowfall. Precipitation is an important factor to recharge groundwater. Another critical factor is temperature, which influences the rate of evapotranspiration. High temperatures increase the rate of evapotranspiration, reducing the amount of water available for groundwater recharge (Dimitriadou & Nikolakopoulos, 2021). During the summer, air temperatures exceed 40°C. The temperatures in the winter are mild and mostly free of frost (NPS, 2024). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is inevitable that climate change will have an impact on the Sonoran Desert region. Changes in precipitation patterns and rising temperatures are likely to influence groundwater recharge processes. Therefore, this research focuses on the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge.\n",

    "### 1.2 Research Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that climate change will have an influence on the hydrological system of the Sonoran Desert. Due to developments and collaborations in hydrological models, more insight can be given on what the impact of climate change will be. This study elaborates on the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge in the Sonoran Desert. This will be done by answering the following main research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "*“How will climate change influence groundwater recharge in the Gila River basin in the Sonoran Desert over the 21st century?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "The main research question will be answered by simulating the groundwater recharge using the PCR-GlobWB model. Sub-questions to answer the main research question are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhat is the groundwater recharge threshold?\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhat forcings are of importance in the Sonoran Desert?\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhich parameters will have an influence on the groundwater recharge?\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFor which climate scenarios will groundwater recharge be simulated, and which scenario will have the biggest impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "When  research questions have been answered by using the PCR-GlobWB model, similar steps will be taken with another model. The wflow model can be used to compare its results with the PCR-GlobWB model. This will give insights into the accuracy of the models and their outcomes.\n",
